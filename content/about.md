Here is **Yet Another** blog (as there are not enough around) about computers, open-source software, projects that I have been putting on hold for too long and anything that comes to my mind that I feel the need to express.

I am a french IT engineer, consulting for a large european, industrial, company. I specialise in data storage and backup.
